# Swiss Army Engineer
What it says on the tin. A suite of tools to help engineer things quickly rather than redoing analysis all the time.

Inspired by the countless [JVN Calc](https://johnvneun.com/blog/2019/12/24/jvn-calc-past-and-future) clones, this aims to (maybe) put an end to the cloning. Maybe it'll just steer it in a different web-based direction. Or maybe

# Aims
- Make something that works without fancy macros, but is still interactive
- Make something that can be used offline (i.e. by downloading this whole repo)
- Provide all the useful analysis tools I've seen to make mechatronic mechanisms in FRC
- Maybe provide basic structural analysis tools (like beam deflection/strength calculators)
