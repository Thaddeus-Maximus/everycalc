Inspired by the countless [JVN Calc](https://johnvneun.com/blog/2019/12/24/jvn-calc-past-and-future) clones, this aims to (maybe) put an end to the cloning, and accomplish some other awesome things in the process.

# Aims Accomplished
- Complex and targeted analysis tools to make mechatronic systems
-- Generalized motorized mechanism
-- Belt sizing
-- Trajectory simulation
-- Flywheel-based launchers

- Basic structural analysis tools
-- Beam deflection and stress tool

- An o-ring groove calculator
- Interactivity with a sleek but simple UX 
- Exportable/savable as a future and portable reference (self-contained files, or at least generation thereof)

# Aims on the Horizon
- Transmission strength calc
- Transient pneumatic cylinder model
- Barrowman stability calculator
