# swissarmyengineer
What it says on the tin. A suite of tools to help engineer things quickly rather than redoing analysis all the time.

Inspired by the countless "JVN Calc" clones, this aims to (maybe) put an end to the cloning. Maybe it'll just steer it in a different web-based direction. Or maybe

Mainly, this aims to:
- Make something that works without fancy macros, but is still interactive (currently, using vanilla JS + google charting)
- Provide all the useful analysis tools I've seen to make mechatronic mechanisms in FRC
- Maybe provide basic structural analysis tools (like beam deflection/strength calculators)
- Material comparisons (would require a hefty database... or a scraper... hmm)
