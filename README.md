# [EveryCalc](https://everycalc.thadhughes.xyz)
A set of analysis tools for common circumstances ranging from slightly annoying, to very complex.

# Aims Accomplished
- Basic structural analysis tools
 - Beam deflection and stress tool
 - Transmission strength tool

- Other simple tools
 - 1D cutlist optimizer
 - O-ring calculator
 - ISO/interference/clearance fit calculator

- Complex and targeted analysis tools to make mechatronic systems
 - Flywheel-based launchers
 - Generalized motorized mechanism
 - Belt sizing
 - Trajectory simulation
 - Rocker pods

- Static reference sheets
- Whitepapers for the models/algorithms

- Interactivity with a sleek but simple UX 
- Exportable/savable as a future and portable reference - self contained files
 - You can download this repo and run individual .html files - no webserver needed!
- English and metric units (in orders of magnitude that are... reasonable... for my uses)

# Aims on the Horizon
- See the Issues section.

# Do you want to help?
Awesome! Let me know, fork this repo, then take a look at the [trajectory source code](trajectory.html). It's got some comments about what's going on, and isn't too overwhelming.

Using [mathjs](https://mathjs.org/) for beam calculator (as some rudimentary FEA is performed).
This project was inspired by the countless [JVN Calc](https://johnvneun.com/blog/2019/12/24/jvn-calc-past-and-future) clones.
