I'd definitely appreciate help on this project.
It's a bit of a mess and I'm only making it messier. "Just one more calculator" I keep telling myself.
I think I've finally built enough different things to get a grasp on _how_ things should be standardized.

If you're interested in contributing, shoot me an email with your ideas and intentions and we'll go from there.
Probably better than going off and writing some awesome code/calculator only for the ground to have shifted.
